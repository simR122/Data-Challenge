This dataset is used for finding pre-requisite edges between academic videos.

File structure:
	
1.output_new.csv - contains potential pre-req edges, labels, video titles and taxonomies along with the features extracted for each edge
2.output_transcript.csv - contains the transcripts video and extracted phrases using textrank for each video 
3.output_embeddings.csv - contains potential pre-req edges, labels, video titles and taxonomies along with fasttext embeddings of each pre-reqs and concept video transcript

*********************** Headers of output_new.csv ***********************

1.label 
	- 0 is not a pre-req
	- 1 is a pre-req
2.pre requisite
	video title of pre-requisite video
3.concept
	video title of concept of video of which pre-requisite is a pre-req
4.pre requisite taxonomy
	taxonomy of pre-requisite video	
5.concept taxonomy
	concept of pre-requisite video
6. rest are the following headers:
	<feature name> 1_2
	1-is first video (A)
	2-is second video (B)
	as shown with the sizes and short description:
	
	'title 12': 20, similarity between titles

 	'similar similar 12': 16, title phrase similarity with content
 	'similar similar 21': 16, title phrase similarity with content
